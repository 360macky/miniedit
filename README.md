## 📦 Deployment
MiniEdit is a web tool for applying simple filters to photos. It is deployed on GitHub Pages, since it does not use any backend but rather vanilla JavaScript for storing and modifying images.


## 🏛️ History
The idea came about after reviewing kousik348's project, Foto.js, a class with methods that modify a photograph by applying filters and effects. I did some code refactoring, and added more filters for this project.

I then proceeded to design the responsive user interface. Using a color palette obtained through Material.io Colors.


## 🎨 UI Design
